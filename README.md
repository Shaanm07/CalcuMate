This is a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is a simple calculator that does basic functions like
adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. There are some additional functions on the calculator like AC (All Clear), DEL (Delete),
and = (Equal Sign). Of course, there are the numbers from 0-9 as well as a decimal option. All simple arithmetic calculations that 
follow the input requirements described above, have a 100% success rate. This means that the calculator is 100% effective. In my 
opinion, I also believe that the application is overall visually appealing. I think that CS50's lecture 8 (about HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript), was very helpful in order to execute this entire project and make it work. I took the help from some online guides to 
assist me when developing this web application and it truly benefited me in numerous ways. 

HTML: This part of the code is mainly for creating the buttons when using the application as well as some of the formatting for these 
buttons. When the HTML code is opened, you can see the different lines of code that describe the overall function of the application. 
The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can
be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Since I wanted to create a 
well-rounded and properly structured application, I included all three languages to design and develop my project.

CSS: As it is in the name, this part of the code does almost all of the visual aspects of the code like adding a linear gradient in the 
background, creating a transition effect in the title, and making the overall application look appealing. Some general information about
CSS and why I used it is due to the following reasons: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets CSS describes how HTML elements are to be 
displayed on screen, paper, or in other media CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. CSS 
makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, my website would be less pleasing to the eye 
and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.

JavaScript: This file allows the application to actually work. JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to 
implement complex features on web pages. The entire project is a web application operated using basic Javascript. It is used to control
the behavior of different elements. Without JavaScript, the web application would not be able to function. 
In other words, the calculator would not calculate.

This is CalcuMate.
